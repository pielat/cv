\cvsection{DevOps motivation}
\cvachievement{\faCloud}{Why do I want to become DevOps?}{I had a great opportunity at Egnyte to work with the DevOps team on a daily basis to solve our customers' issues. In addition, I developed an application which makes our lives much easier. During my career, I worked mainly as a System Administrator, but when I had an opportunity to get hands-on experience with DevOps tools like Kubernetes, Google Cloud, Terraform etc. I found it very interesting. Furthermore, the DevOps culture was what I like the most.}
%\cvachievement{\faCloud}{Plan to become a DevOps Engineer.}{Although I've already had experience with CI/CD at Egnyte, I wanted to prove my qualification for this role, so I've already passed the LFCS exam and I am studying for the next certifications: AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner, AWS Certified SysOps Administrator - Associate and Certified Kubernetes Administrator. As the next step, I'm planning to dig much deeper into terraform, since "infrastructure as code" seems to me a very interesting concept.}
